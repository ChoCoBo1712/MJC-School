# Syllabus

## What is Syllabus?
As a student, you may have heard the word “syllabus” and wondered what that is, or the term “syllabus” might be a brand-new word for you. A syllabus is a document that outlines all the essential information about a college course. It lists the topics you will study, as well as the due dates of any coursework including tests, quizzes, or exams. 

Since our school is continous process, we alter syllabus definition to exclude due dates and some other parts like quizes.
