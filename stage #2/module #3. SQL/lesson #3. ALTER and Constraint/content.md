# ALTER and Constraint
This module is about constraints, and the way we work with it. 
We are able to specify not only the type of the filed in the table, but also the rules according to which the data will be checked while performing different kinds of actions. 

## Tasks: 
1)	Change table ‘Student’. 
 ‘Birthday’ field cannot be null
2)	Change table ‘Mark’
‘Mark’ should be in range from 1 to 10
‘Student_Id’ and ‘Subject_Id’ cannot be null
3)	Change table ‘Subject’
‘Grade’ should be in range from 1 to 5 
4)	Change table ‘PaymentType’
‘Name’ should be a unique value
5)	Change table ‘Payment’
‘Type’, ‘Amount’ and ‘Date’ cannot be null
